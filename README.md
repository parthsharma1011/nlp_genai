# NLP & GenAI Learning Repository

A comprehensive repository for Natural Language Processing and Generative AI implementations, from basic concepts to advanced production-ready applications.

## Repository Structure

### `/learn_1/` - NLP Fundamentals
Basic NLP concepts and implementations using traditional libraries like NLTK, spaCy, and scikit-learn.

**What you'll find:**
- Text preprocessing techniques
- Sentiment analysis implementations
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Topic modeling with LDA
- Sequence-to-sequence models
- Customer feedback analysis systems

### `/genai_folder/` - Advanced GenAI Applications
Production-ready implementations using modern LLMs and vector databases.

**What you'll find:**
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) systems
- Chat with files functionality
- Vector database integrations
- LangChain agent implementations
- Configuration management

## Quick Start

### For NLP Learning (learn_1)
```bash
cd learn_1/
pip install -r requirements.txt
python basics.py
```

### For GenAI Applications (genai_folder)
```bash
cd genai_folder/
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Configure your API keys in utils/config.py
python rag.py
```

## Key Technologies

**NLP Fundamentals:**
- NLTK for text processing
- spaCy for advanced NLP
- scikit-learn for machine learning
- TensorFlow for deep learning

**GenAI Stack:**
- LangChain for LLM orchestration
- FAISS for vector similarity search
- Google Gemini for language generation
- HuggingFace Transformers

## Learning Path

1. **Start with `/learn_1/`** - Master NLP fundamentals
2. **Progress to `/genai_folder/`** - Build production applications
3. **Experiment and modify** - Adapt code for your use cases
